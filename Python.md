## Python Projects:

### Mastermind:

Mastermind is an interactive concole program. I implemented the algorithm in collaboration with a classmate during my first programming class.

### Naive Bayes Classifier:

During my studies at a course of probability and machine learning at Stanford University, I wrote a simple Naive Bayes Classifer that made classifications based on the input data. 
The algorithm was trained using the given training datasets and its accuracy was tested using the testing datasets. Various types of optimizations were also 
incorporated, such as Laplace smoothing method.
